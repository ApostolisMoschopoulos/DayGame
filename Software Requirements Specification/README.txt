This is the LaTeX version of the SRS

To propose changes:

1. Download "Software Requirements Specification" folder
2. Upload to Overleaf for an online LaTeX compiler
3. Make changes safely by compiling regularly
4. Open a Pull Request and write a short description of your changes
5. Await review

If you don't want to use Overleaf you will have to download an IDE with a LaTeX compiler.
First time compilation might take some time for all the packages to be installed.
